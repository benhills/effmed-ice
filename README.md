Matrix model for polarized electromagnetic wave propagation through ice based on Fujita et al. (2006). The model uses Jones vectors to represent any single polarization state with updates to the polarization based on both anisotropic transmission (birefringence) and scattering. By assuming that the radar wavelength is longer than the scale of the anisotropic ice crystals we can approximate the ice as an effective medium.
